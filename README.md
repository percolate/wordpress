This is an updated plugin for importing Custom Creative templates from Percolate into Wordpress. It requires Wordpress 4.1 and is tested up to 4.4.2.

*Note:* The legacy plugin is no longer being supported by Percolate. While it may continue to function, continued functionality is not guaranteed. For more information, or to upgrade to the new plugin, please reach out to your Percolate Engagement Manager.
